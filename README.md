# Glided Rose kata

This is my attempt at implementing the Glided Rose from scratch based on my interpretation of the requirements and applying TDD.

The original Kata can be found [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose), which is created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes).

Note: The goblin does not exist since it's my own implementation.
